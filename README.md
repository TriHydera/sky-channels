Hello who ever found this,

This is nothing but a list of the Sky channels for England that I uploaded as different file formats for you to use for what ever you want to in your projects and do something cool with it. Its based on England but the channels will have the same numbers anyway to it shouldn't matter much.

> Look in the `datasets` folder for the files that you will need.
